#Minesweeper JS

This is a terminal version of the classic minesweeper game.
It is meant to be run from a terminal by using a local node server.

In order to run the program please use the following command:
```bash
[example@ex ~/Downloads/minesweeper]$ node minesweeper.js
```

##Our goal

This program is being created with the purpose of learning JS and some Node.js functionality
in a fun way. As such it is a work in progress and not guarenteed to be fully functional.
